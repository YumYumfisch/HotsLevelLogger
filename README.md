# Heroes of the Storm - Level Logger
## About
This is a tool that captures screenshots of players during the loading screen of the game `Heroes of the Storm`.  
The tool will analse their levels using using `IronOCR`, a library for optical character recognition.  
Discord integration is used to automatically log these levels and screenshots into a discord channel if their level is a funny number.  

## How to use
It should be as simple as running `HotsLevelLogger.exe` after making sure the config file exists.  
At the time of writing this, this means `token.txt` has to exist in the folder `C:\Temp` with the token of the discord bot.

## Why?
Dont ask.  
It's definitely not 100% pointless.
