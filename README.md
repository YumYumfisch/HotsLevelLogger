# Heroes of the Storm - Level Logger
## About
This is a tool that captures screenshots of players during the loading screen of the game `Heroes of the Storm`.  
The tool will analyse their levels using `Tesseract`, an optical character recognition engine.  
Discord integration is used to automatically log these levels and screenshots into a Discord channel.  

## How to use
It should be as simple as running `HotsLevelLogger.exe` after making sure the file `DiscordConfig.txt` exists in the directory `E:\HotsLevelLogger`.  
The first line of the file has to contain the Discord bot token, the second line contains the ID of the Discord channel that the messages will be sent to.

## Why?
Dont ask.  
It's definitely not 100% pointless.
